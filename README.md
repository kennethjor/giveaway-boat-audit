# Giveaway Boat Audit

Audit of [Giveaway Boat's](https://giveaway.boats/) random selection algorithm.
[Awesome Stickz](https://github.com/awesomestickz) was kind enough to provide an excerpt of the source code for me to audit.
The methods used in this audit are not exhaustive, and probably a bit ghetto to someone intimately familiar with
statistical analysis, but my goal was to confirm the algorithm didn't contain any obvious bias.

So is the algorithm good? **Yes, it's fine!**
